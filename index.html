		<h2>DUHAYNIE BRUFF</h2>
		<p>One of the most and probably only interesting thing about me is my last name and the fact that my first name is a last name as people are always so quick to point out. So excited to be registered for this course this semester and I hope that I do well. One thing I like about web development is the ability to be able to know and modify what goes on behind the scenes and understand the building block of the web.</p>
